    <p> Data is defined as unstructured information such as text,
observations, images, symbols, and descriptions on the other hand,
Information refers to processed, organized, and structured data. It
gives context to the facts and facilitates decision-making.
Data contains numbers, statements, and characters in a raw form.</p>

    <p class="topic"> <b> INFORMATION </b></p>
    <p> Information is defined as structured, organized, and processed data,
presented within a context that makes it relevant and useful to the
person who needs it. Data suggests that raw facts and figures
regarding individuals, places, or the other issue, that is expressed
within the type of numbers, letters or symbols.
In short, once knowledge ends up being purposeful when
conversing, it’s referred to as info. It’s one thing that informs,
in essence, it provides a solution to a specific question. It
may be obtained from numerous sources like newspapers,
the internet, television, people, books, etc. </p>

 <p class="topic"> <b> INFORMATION SYSTEM </b></p>
 <p> An information system (IS) is an interconnected set of components used to collect, store,
process and transmit data and digital information. At its core, it is a collection of hardware,
software, data, people and processes that work together to transform raw data into useful
information. An IS supports a variety of business objectives, such as improved customer
service or increased operational efficiency. In our tech-dependent world, information
systems often require a combination of both people and computers to function optimally.
They not only provide, organize, and analyze data, but also present valuable information in
a way that helps businesses make impactful decisions. </p>

    <div class="column"> 
        <p  class="topic" style="text-align: left;"><b> ► MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS </b> </p> 
        <p> A management information system (MIS) gives comprehensive, necessary insight 
            into specificcircumstances. These daily, monthly, quarterly,or annual reports often consist 
            of different kinds of data that help middle or senior managers problem-solve and make impactful business decisions. </p>

    </div>
     <div class="column"> 
        <p  class="topic"><b> ► DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS </b> </p> 
        <p> Similar to an MIS, a decision support system(DSS) helps managers make data-driven decisions. 
            As an interactive information system, it collects and preserves large amounts of information 
            that may be needed to support the reasoning behind certain business choices. Managers can use 
            DSS reports to compare and contrast information, as they sometimes provide charts or tables for easy analysis </p>

        <p> A transaction processing system (TPS) stores,
processes, and distributes transactional data so
that designated employees can easily access
information when needed. Some examples of
transactional data include bank deposits, payroll,
sales, and other expenses that help maintain
daily operations </p>

     <div class="column"> 
        <p  class="topic"><b> ► EXECUTIVE SUPPORT SYSTEMS </b> </p> 
        <p> An Executive support system (ESS) is also
commonly used by higher-level executives when
they need to lead company activities. It collects
data from a DSS and MIS, then presents both
internal and external information that decisionmakers can use for their strategy. </p>

    <p class="topic" style="text-align: center;"> <b> ANALYSIS / REACTION </b></p>

    <p class="ar"> The rapid advancement of technology has prompted organizations to increasingly
rely on it for more efficient and effective ways to achieve their goals. Across every industry—
education, business, music, politics, and daily life—technology empowers people and
organizations to collect data, process information, and make well-informed decisions.
Information systems play a crucial role in analyzing and sharing information among diverse
groups, ensuring individuals receive and utilize the information necessary for success. <br>
Although often used interchangeably, data and information have distinct
meanings. Data comprise raw, unprocessed facts—such as characters, images, symbols, or
numbers—that can be either quantitative or qualitative. Information, by contrast, is data that
has been processed and organized to become meaningful and useful to humans. For instance,
a list of sales transactions represents data; when analyzed and processed, this data transforms
into valuable information, enabling companies to assess business progress and improve
strategies <br> <br>
In today’s digital world, organizations also depend on information systems to translate data
into information. An <b>information system (IS) </b>refers to an interconnected set of components
(hardware, software, people, data, and processes) that is used to collect, store, and transmit
information. The components of information systems include hardware (people can physically
see and touch), software (provides a list of commands and functions), database (a collection
of relevant data), network (an interconnected system that exchanges electronic data), and
human resources (people with technical skills). There are different types of support systems
that can cover the needs of various people and organizations. A <b>Transaction Processing
System (TPS)</b> is used by the operational-level system that stores, processes, and distributes
transactional data for easier access and keeps track of incoming and outgoing transactions. A
<b>Management Information System (MIS)</b> ensures the smooth operation of the organization by
giving comprehensive, necessary insights, and is commonly used by middle managers. A
<b>Decision Support System (DSS)</b> is often used by senior-level management to analyze existing
structured information, compare information, and help support why certain decisions are
necessary.<br> <br>
 An <b>Executive Information System (EIS)</b> helps executives and senior managers analyze longterm trends, collect data from DSS and MSS, and aid businesses in achieving stronger decisionmaking. Together, these systems work to support organizations and move towards their goals.
Through different information systems, people can connect with each other and cooperate to
succeed. I understood that an IS does not simply handle technical information, it improves
productivity, fosters better communication, supports better decision-making skills, thus
leading to organizational growth. Understanding these terms and concepts helped me realize
how technology bridges the gap between information and effective decision-making.
Information systems turn meaningless data into valuable information that, in turn, allows
individuals to construct decisions based on clear evidence and statistics rather than
speculation.<br> <br>
 Moreover, managing information requires not only technical skills but also the ability
to ask the right questions and apply them responsibly and efficiently. Learning how these work
is critical to adapt and maximize the potential of technology, and empowers everyone to be a
critical user of information and technology. In my own experience, I have applied these skills in
projects where data analysis was needed, including our research project regarding the financial
literacy of students.<br> <br>
Information systems have significantly contributed to the success of organizations by
allowing users to interact with technology in a manner that simplifies work and helps leaders
enhance their decision-making and problem-solving skills. Without these data, information, and
systems working together, businesses and institutions would struggle to adapt, compete, and
grow. As a student and a future professional, I recognize the importance of equipping myself
with this knowledge to become a capable and efficient user of information and technology in
this continuously evolving world. <br>
