        <p class="topic"> <b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
        <p> A motherboard (sometimes known as the
Mainboard, system board, and logic board) is
the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a
computer system. This is where many of the
crucial components are located, such as the
CPU and memory. It is considered as the
backbone of the computer as it allows
communication between all internal
components such as the memory, processor,
graphics card, CPU, storage devices and others.</p>

        <p class="topic"> <b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
        <p> Form Factor refers to the size, shapes, dimensions and layouts of a desktop computer and
determines how the board fits in the computer case. The build is the overall design and
structure of the motherboard, while CPU slots are where the CPU is located. Memory slot
refers to the number of slots (memory) that the system can hold. Chipsets are a set of
electronic components that manage data transfer between I/O devices and are often
called the brain of the motherboard. The BIOS or basic input/output system lets users
access and set up the system and includes instructions on how to load basic computer
hardware (UEFI is a modern version). PCI or Peripheral Component Interconnect Slots are
expansions where extra components like graphic cards can be added. SATA or Serial
Advanced Technology Attachment is used to connect hard drives and solid-state drives to
the motherboard. <br> <br>
There are many different types of motherboards to meet different computing needs. Large
motherboards such as ATX, Standard-ATX, and Extended ATX offer many CPU and
memory slots and advanced chipsets. Airflow and cooling condition of these motherboards
also maintains a smooth performance despite the heavy workload. This makes them ideal
for gaming and professional setups that require high-end graphics and overclocking.
On the other hand, smaller motherboards such as Micro-ATX, Mini-ATX, and Mini-ITX give
emphasis on space efficiency and cost over expansion. Compared to the previous boards,
these types support fewer PCI slots but have compact builds to compensate for the limited
space. AT and LPX motherboards have old designs that have been replaced as newer
motherboards have been developed. These motherboard designs have limited designs and
compatibility. Lastly, the BTX and Pico-BTX designs provide more efficient airflow and
cooling but are not widely adopted.<br> <br> 

In conclusion, the various types of motherboard designs show the development of
technology in recent years and how it has adapted to the needs of the users and demands
for high-performance computing systems. Nowadays, users have a wide range of options
depending on their needs and preferences.</p>
