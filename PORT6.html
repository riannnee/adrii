        <p class="topic"> <b> INTRODUCTION </b> </p>
        <p> A computer is an electronic device that has
the ability to store, process, and retrieve
data. It executes and responds to a set of
instructions and combines hardware and
software to perform certain tasks.
Nowadays, it is used in various industries
and has become an indispensable part of
human development.

        <p class="topic"> <b>DISCUSSION</b> </p>
        <p> Computers are designed to handle specific jobs but a single computer is not enough to
meet the unique needs of the people. Because of this, there are various types of
computers. </p> <br>
        <p> &#x2022; A supercomputer is considered the biggest and fastest type of computer and is
used for specialized applications that require large amounts of mathematical
computation, scientific simulations, weather forecasting, nuclear energy research,
and more. It can process trillions of functions within a few seconds. An example of
this is the Selene (NVIDIA), which has a memory of 1 TB and has extremely high
calculating power. </p> 
        <p> &#x2022; A mainframe computer is a powerful computer that is useful when a large number of
people are involved. It is popular for its security, reliability, and its ability to manage
immense workloads. It is designed to process large amounts of data and perform
many transactions quickly and efficiently. An example of this is the IBM z16 with a
memory of 40 TB and high energy consumption. </p>
        <p> &#x2022; A Mini Computer is smaller and less powerful than the previous two. It is a
multiprocessing system that can support 200 users simultaneously and is mainly
used for scientific research, and organizations such as accounting firms. An
example of this is the PDP-11 with a Moderate Calculating power and a memory of 4
MB </p>
        <p> &#x2022; A Computer Server is used to store, manage, and distribute data or services to
client computers inside a network. It is a powerful device that can provide various
services such as web hosting and network storage. An example of it is the Dell
PowerEdge that has a moderate energy consumption and a memory of 64 GB to 2
TB </p>
        <p> &#x2022; A workstation is a high-powered computer built for one user to accomplish heavy
tasks such as animating and designing buildings. It is smaller than a mainframe
computer but stronger than a personal computer. An example of this is Apple
MacBook Pro with a memory of 32 GB and a high calculating power. </p>
        <p> &#x2022; Micro Computers are also known as personal computers. It is designed for
personal use and can perform basic functions of the computer. It is usually not
advised for complicated tasks due to its limited processing capacity. It usually
requires minimal space and is inexpensive compared to previous types of
computers mentioned. An example of this is the Dell OptiPlex with a memory of 32
GB and low energy consumption. </p> <br>
<p> Learning about these types of computers are a step in understanding how each one
has a specific function depending on its functions and power. This shows how
technology is constantly evolving to meet the unique needs of people and
organizations. There is no “better” computer as they all have their own strengths and
have specific purposes. </p>

    <p class="topic"> <b> MINI COMPUTER, MICRO COMPUTER, WORKSTATION, AND SERVER </b></p>
        <p> Mini computers, microcomputers, workstation, and servers have different processing
speed, memory capacity, power consumption, and usage. Mini Computers have
moderate processing speed and memory which can support several users and
perform tasks simultaneously, thus require stable power and proper cooling, This
type of computer is suitable for laboratories and small organizations. Micro
computers, also considered as personal computers, are intended for single users
and basic tasks which is why they have lower processing speed and memory
capacity and require less power. They are usually used at home and at offices.
Workstation computers, however, are more powerful than personal computers as
they are designed for professionals who require large memory and powerful graphic
capabilities for tasks such as 3D modeling and engineering design.
On the other hand, Servers have the highest processing speed and memory capacity
among these and are built to handle multiple users and large amounts of data. Because
of this, they also consume the most power in order to provide services such as web
hosting and storage. To summarize, all four computers have their own strengths and
weaknesses, but they vary in power, performance, and purpose.</p>
