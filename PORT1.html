        <p  class="CompSci" style="text-align: center;"><b> COMPUTER SCIENCE AS A DISCIPLINE </b> </p> 
        <p class="csdef"> Computer Science is the academic discipline concerned with computing. The
            intellectual processes of the discipline combine theory, abstraction, and design.
            Problems are solved in a distinctive manner, with an overall goal of identifying and
            applying recurring conceptual principles. Although these intellectual processes
            derive from other disciplines, a computer scientist’s perspective offers a unique
            and important voice in a community of learning such as a liberal-arts college. </p>
            <p class="csdef"> Computer science became a discipline in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The field
            grew out of the efforts of electrical engineers and mathematicians to build devices
            capable of automated mechanical computation. Computer scientists study how
            to build the physical devices that comprise computing systems, how to create the
            algorithms and software systems that control these devices, and the more
            theoretical questions pertaining to what problems even have algorithmic solutions.

    <p class="ar"> <b>Computer Science (CS)</b>  emerged as a distinct discipline in the late 1950s and early
1960s. Today, it remains one of the most significant and rapidly evolving fields of study
in today’s fast-paced world. Computer Science is an academic discipline that revolves
around the study of computers, developing theoretical foundations, design, and
practical applications. It equips students and professionals with the necessary
knowledge and skills to understand technology on a deeper level and how to utilize it
to address problems prevalent in our society. Computer Science is now used in almost
every industry, including healthcare, education, business, agriculture, and
entertainment. <br> <br>
Some researchers argue that computer science is more closely related to
mathematics than to science itself. In an article written by Black (2024), he argued
whether computer science covers an area of scientific examination. He noted that
calling Computer Science ‘science’ is a fraud because humans have created
computers when physics, biology, and chemistry already exist in the world. However, I
disagree with this perspective. Science is both a body of knowledge and the process
for building that knowledge. It is a means to evaluate and create new knowledge.
Computer scientists formulate hypotheses, use experimentation, develop theoretical
models, and validate results in a manner similar to others in other scientific disciplines.
But in contrast to traditional science, computer science is primarily concerned with the
study of artificial systems. <br> <br>
I came to realize that studying a computing discipline is broader than I thought. It
extends far beyond the area of programming and offers a wide range of career
options. Computing is a family of various disciplines that branches into several more
disciplines. These include Computer Engineering (CE), which aims to develop and
design software and hardware systems; Computer Science (CS), which focuses on the
theory of computational systems and practical aspects such as operating systems,
algorithms, and programming ; Software Engineering (SE), which deals with the design,
development and maintenance of software applications; Data Science (DS), which
focus on data analysis and statistics; and Information Technology (IT), which manage
computer systems and networks. A student pursuing a degree in these disciplines will
be able to specialize in areas such as cybersecurity, robotics, web development,
networking, business analytics, and many more. <br> <br>
It amazes me how Computer Science provides students with numerous opportunities
for careers related to technology and how this field is beneficial in other disciplines,
such as medicine. This academic discipline enables individuals to be creative while
employing logic and innovation to devise solutions that address real-world problems.
As technology continues to evolve, its influence on society becomes more evident, and
new areas of specialization continue to emerge. I know this will be a course that I will not regret pursuing <br>
